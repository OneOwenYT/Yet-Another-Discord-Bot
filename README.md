# Yet-Another-Discord-Bot

# V0.1.1, An Actual update!
I have added some extra stuff to the "Slash Commands test.py" file to use it as a user application to inform people of the dangers of the "USE_EXTERNAL_APPS" permission since I noticed alot of servers have it enabled

# Bugs and stuff
Couldnt get .env files to work properly, they would just return nothing, other than that, same as the previous update.
# Extra info
Im now going to start working on the project directly in VSC connected to github so I can hopefully keep it more updated as I go!
# Plans for the future
Fixing the leveling system within the next couple of updates, by update v0.1.5 or around then switching all commands to /commands (its gonna be a pain :cry:), and adding more backrooms levels to the backrooms.json (I dont even remember why I added it, its supposed to be a SCP bot :| ).



# Old Updates


# V0.1.0, The first commit.
Making this repo wasnt fun, im going to try to read more of the documentation on how to make repo's but I just keep getting confused, I accidentaly leaked my bot token first time making one aswell.
# Bugs and stuff
Moderation stuff in "moderation.py" like warnings do not work properly, and "level.py" has an issue with leveling that I cant figure out.
# Extra info
The "Slash Commands test.py" file was just made for me to mess around and learn how to utilize the /commands thingy.
