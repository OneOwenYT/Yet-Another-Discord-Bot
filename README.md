# Yet-Another-Discord-Bot
# V0.5, 
Making this repo wasnt fun, im going to try to read more of the documentation on how to make repo's but I just keep getting confused, I accidentaly leaked my bot token first time making one aswell.
# Bugs and stuff
Moderation stuff in "moderation.py" like warnings do not work properly, and "level.py" has an issue with leveling that I cant figure out.
# Extra info
The "Slash Commands test.py" file was just made for me to mess around and learn how to utilize the /commands thingy.
